# Lesson 23: Natural Language Processing for Code Understanding

## Introduction (10 minutes)

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans using natural language. In the context of code understanding, NLP techniques can be powerful tools to bridge the gap between human language and programming languages. This lesson will explore how to implement NLP features in our AI-assisted coding tool to enhance code comprehension, search, and interaction.

## Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

1. Implement natural language queries for code search
2. Develop a code-to-natural-language explanation system
3. Create an intent recognition system for user commands
4. Implement a context-aware chat system
5. Develop a code summarization tool

## Project Structure

Before we dive into the implementation, let's look at the project structure for our AI-assisted coding tool. We'll be adding new modules and updating existing ones to incorporate NLP features.

```

Now, let's implement each of the NLP features step by step.

## 1. Implementing Natural Language Queries for Code Search (30 minutes)

Natural language queries allow users to search their codebase using human language instead of specific keywords or regular expressions. We'll implement this feature using a combination of text processing and vector similarity search.

First, let's create the `code_search.py` file in the `nlp` directory:

```python
# aider/nlp/code_search.py

import os
from typing import List, Tuple
import numpy as np
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

class CodeSearchEngine:
    def __init__(self, code_base_path: str):
        self.code_base_path = code_base_path
        self.files = []
        self.file_contents = []
        self.vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words='english')
        self.tfidf_matrix = None
        self._index_code_base()

    def _index_code_base(self):
        for root, _, files in os.walk(self.code_base_path):
            for file in files:
                if file.endswith('.py'):  # You can add more file extensions as needed
                    file_path = os.path.join(root, file)
                    with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
                        content = f.read()
                    self.files.append(file_path)
                    self.file_contents.append(content)
        
        self.tfidf_matrix = self.vectorizer.fit_transform(self.file_contents)

    def search(self, query: str, top_k: int = 5) -> List[Tuple[str, float]]:
        query_vector = self.vectorizer.transform([query])
        similarities = cosine_similarity(query_vector, self.tfidf_matrix).flatten()
        top_indices = similarities.argsort()[-top_k:][::-1]
        
        results = []
        for idx in top_indices:
            results.append((self.files[idx], similarities[idx]))
        
        return results

# Usage example
if __name__ == "__main__":
    search_engine = CodeSearchEngine("/path/to/your/codebase")
    results = search_engine.search("function to calculate fibonacci numbers")
    for file, score in results:
        print(f"File: {file}, Relevance: {score:.2f}")
```

This implementation uses TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization and cosine similarity to find the most relevant code files based on the natural language query. 

To integrate this into our main CLI, we'll add a new command in `cli/commands.py`:

```python
# aider/cli/commands.py

import click
from aider.nlp.code_search import CodeSearchEngine

@click.command()
@click.argument('query', nargs=-1)
@click.option('--top-k', default=5, help='Number of results to return')
def search_code(query, top_k):
    """Search the codebase using natural language queries."""
    query = ' '.join(query)
    search_engine = CodeSearchEngine(".")  # Assuming the current directory is the codebase
    results = search_engine.search(query, top_k)
    
    click.echo(f"Top {top_k} results for query: '{query}'")
    for file, score in results:
        click.echo(f"File: {file}, Relevance: {score:.2f}")

# Add this command to your main CLI group
```

## 2. Developing a Code-to-Natural Language Explanation System (30 minutes)

Next, we'll create a system that can explain code snippets in natural language. We'll use OpenAI's GPT model for this task. Create a new file `code_explanation.py` in the `nlp` directory:

```python
# aider/nlp/code_explanation.py

import openai
from aider.ai.openai_integration import get_openai_client

class CodeExplainer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.client = get_openai_client()

    def explain_code(self, code_snippet: str) -> str:
        prompt = f"""
        Please explain the following Python code in simple terms:

        ```python
        {code_snippet}
        ```

        Provide a clear and concise explanation of what the code does.
        """

        response = self.client.chat.completions.create(
            model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
            messages=[
                {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful coding assistant that explains Python code."},
                {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
            ]
        )

        return response.choices[0].message.content.strip()

# Usage example
if __name__ == "__main__":
    explainer = CodeExplainer()
    code = """
    def fibonacci(n):
        if n <= 1:
            return n
        else:
            return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
    """
    explanation = explainer.explain_code(code)
    print(explanation)
```

Now, let's add this feature to our CLI:

```python
# aider/cli/commands.py

import click
from aider.nlp.code_explanation import CodeExplainer

@click.command()
@click.argument('file_path', type=click.Path(exists=True))
def explain_code(file_path):
    """Explain the code in the given file using natural language."""
    with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
        code = f.read()
    
    explainer = CodeExplainer()
    explanation = explainer.explain_code(code)
    
    click.echo(f"Explanation of {file_path}:")
    click.echo(explanation)

# Add this command to your main CLI group
```

## 3. Creating an Intent Recognition System for User Commands (25 minutes)

An intent recognition system can help understand the user's intentions from natural language commands. We'll use a simple keyword-based approach for this example, but in a production system, you might want to use more advanced NLP techniques or machine learning models.

Create a new file `intent_recognition.py` in the `nlp` directory:

```python
# aider/nlp/intent_recognition.py

from typing import Tuple

class IntentRecognizer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.intents = {
            "search": ["search", "find", "look for"],
            "explain": ["explain", "describe", "tell me about"],
            "summarize": ["summarize", "give me a summary of"],
            "refactor": ["refactor", "improve", "clean up"],
            "test": ["test", "create test", "write test"],
        }

    def recognize_intent(self, command: str) -> Tuple[str, str]:
        command = command.lower()
        for intent, keywords in self.intents.items():
            if any(keyword in command for keyword in keywords):
                return intent, command
        
        return "unknown", command

# Usage example
if __name__ == "__main__":
    recognizer = IntentRecognizer()
    intents = [
        "search for fibonacci function",
        "explain the code in utils.py",
        "summarize the project structure",
        "refactor the login function",
        "create a test for the user class",
        "what's the weather like today?"
    ]
    
    for command in intents:
        intent, remaining = recognizer.recognize_intent(command)
        print(f"Command: {command}")
        print(f"Recognized Intent: {intent}")
        print(f"Remaining Command: {remaining}")
        print()
```

Now, let's integrate this into our main CLI to handle natural language commands:

```python
# aider/cli/commands.py

import click
from aider.nlp.intent_recognition import IntentRecognizer

@click.command()
@click.argument('command', nargs=-1)
def process_command(command):
    """Process a natural language command."""
    command = ' '.join(command)
    recognizer = IntentRecognizer()
    intent, remaining = recognizer.recognize_intent(command)
    
    if intent == "search":
        search_code([remaining])
    elif intent == "explain":
        # Extract file path from the remaining command
        # This is a simplified example; you might need more robust parsing
        file_path = remaining.split()[-1]
        explain_code(file_path)
    elif intent == "summarize":
        # Implement summarize functionality
        click.echo("Summarize functionality not implemented yet.")
    elif intent == "refactor":
        # Implement refactor functionality
        click.echo("Refactor functionality not implemented yet.")
    elif intent == "test":
        # Implement test creation functionality
        click.echo("Test creation functionality not implemented yet.")
    else:
        click.echo(f"Unknown command. Intent: {intent}, Command: {command}")

# Add this command to your main CLI group
```

## 4. Implementing a Context-Aware Chat System (30 minutes)

A context-aware chat system can maintain a conversation history and provide more relevant responses based on the ongoing dialogue. We'll implement a simple chat system that keeps track of the conversation and uses it to generate more contextual responses.

Create a new file `context_chat.py` in the `nlp` directory:

```python
# aider/nlp/context_chat.py

from typing import List, Dict
import openai
from aider.ai.openai_integration import get_openai_client

class ContextChat:
    def __init__(self):
        self.client = get_openai_client()
        self.conversation_history: List[Dict[str, str]] = []

    def chat(self, user_input: str) -> str:
        self.conversation_history.append({"role": "user", "content": user_input})
        
        messages = [
            {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful AI coding assistant."},
            *self.conversation_history
        ]

        response = self.client.chat.completions.create(
            model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
            messages=messages
        )

        assistant_response = response.choices[0].message.content.strip()
        self.conversation_history.append({"role": "assistant", "content": assistant_response})

        return assistant_response

    def clear_history(self):
        self.conversation_history = []

# Usage example
if __name__ == "__main__":
    chat = ContextChat()
    
    while True:
        user_input = input("You: ")
        if user_input.lower() == "exit":
            break
        
        response = chat.chat(user_input)
        print(f"AI: {response}")
```

Now, let's add this chat system to our CLI:

```python
# aider/cli/commands.py

import click
from aider.nlp.context_chat import ContextChat

@click.command()
def interactive_chat():
    """Start an interactive chat session with the AI coding assistant."""
    chat = ContextChat()
    click.echo("Starting interactive chat. Type 'exit' to end the session.")
    
    while True:
        user_input = click.prompt("You", type=str)
        if user_input.lower() == "exit":
            break
        
        response = chat.chat(user_input)
        click.echo(f"AI: {response}")
    
    click.echo("Chat session ended.")

# Add this command to your main CLI group
```

## 5. Developing a Code Summarization Tool (25 minutes)

Finally, we'll create a tool that can generate concise summaries of code files or entire projects. This can be particularly useful for quickly understanding the structure and purpose of unfamiliar codebases.

Create a new file `code_summarization.py` in the `nlp` directory:

```python
# aider/nlp/code_summarization.py

import os
import openai
from aider.ai.openai_integration import get_openai_client

class CodeSummarizer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.client = get_openai_client()

    def summarize_file(self, file_path: str) -> str:
        with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
            code = f.read()
        
        prompt = f"""
        Please provide a concise summary of the following Python code:

        ```python
        {code}
        ```

        Include the main purpose of the code, key functions or classes, and any important logic or algorithms.
        """

        response = self.client.chat.completions.create(
            model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
            messages=[
                {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful coding assistant that summarizes Python code."},
                {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
            ]
        )

        return response.choices[0].message.content.strip()

    def summarize_project(self, project_path: str) -> str:
        summaries = []
        for root, _, files in os.walk(project_path):
            for file in files:
                if file.endswith('.py'):
                    file_path = os.path.join(root, file)
                    relative_path = os.path.relpath(file_path, project_path)
                    summary = self.summarize_file(file_path)
                    summaries.append(f"{relative_path}:\n{summary}\n")
        
        project_summary = "\n".join(summaries)
        
        prompt = f"""
        Based on the following summaries of Python files in a project, provide an overall summary of the project:

        {project_summary}

        Include the main purpose of the project, key components, and how they interact.
        """

        response = self.client.chat.completions.create(
            model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
            messages=[
                {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful coding assistant that summarizes Python projects."},
                {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
            ]
        )

        return response.choices[0].message.content.strip()

# Usage example
if __name__ == "__main__":
    summarizer = CodeSummarizer()
    file_summary = summarizer.summarize_file("path/to/your/file.py")
    print("File Summary:")
    print(file_summary)
    
    project_summary = summarizer.summarize_project("path/to/your/project")
    print("\nProject Summary:")
    print(project_summary)
```

Now, let's add these summarization features to our CLI:

```python
# aider/cli/commands.py

import click
from aider.nlp.code_summarization import CodeSummarizer

@click.command()
@click.argument('path', type=click.Path(exists=True))
@click.option('--project', is_flag=True, help="Summarize entire project instead of a single file")
def summarize_code(path, project):
    """Summarize a Python file or an entire project."""
    summarizer = CodeSummarizer()
    
    if project:
        summary = summarizer.summarize_project(path)
        click.echo(f"Project Summary for {path}:")
    else:
        summary = summarizer.summarize_file(path)
        click.echo(f"File Summary for {path}:")
    
    click.echo(summary)

# Add this command to your main CLI group
```

## Practical Exercise (30 minutes)

Now that we have implemented all the NLP features, let's create a practical exercise to tie everything together. We'll create a new command that combines all the NLP features we've built.

Add the following to your `cli/commands.py` file:

```python
# aider/cli/commands.py

import click
from aider.nlp.code_search import CodeSearchEngine
from aider.nlp.code_explanation import CodeExplainer
from aider.nlp.intent_recognition import IntentRecognizer
from aider.nlp.context_chat import ContextChat
from aider.nlp.code_summarization import CodeSummarizer

@click.command()
@click.argument('query', nargs=-1)
def nlp_assistant(query):
    """An AI assistant that uses NLP to understand and process your coding queries."""
    query = ' '.join(query)
    recognizer = IntentRecognizer()
    intent, remaining = recognizer.recognize_intent(query)

    if intent == "search":
        search_engine = CodeSearchEngine(".")
        results = search_engine.search(remaining, top_k=3)
        click.echo("Here are the most relevant files for your query:")
        for file, score in results:
            click.echo(f"- {file} (Relevance: {score:.2f})")

    elif intent == "explain":
        explainer = CodeExplainer()
        # For simplicity, we'll assume the remaining query is a file path
        with open(remaining, 'r') as f:
            code = f.read()
        explanation = explainer.explain_code(code)
        click.echo(f"Explanation of {remaining}:")
        click.echo(explanation)

    elif intent == "summarize":
        summarizer = CodeSummarizer()
        if os.path.isfile(remaining):
            summary = summarizer.summarize_file(remaining)
            click.echo(f"Summary of {remaining}:")
        else:
            summary = summarizer.summarize_project(remaining)
            click.echo(f"Summary of project {remaining}:")
        click.echo(summary)

    else:
        chat = ContextChat()
        response = chat.chat(query)
        click.echo(f"AI Assistant: {response}")

# Add this command to your main CLI group
```

This new `nlp_assistant` command combines all the NLP features we've built into a single interface. It uses the intent recognition system to determine what the user wants to do, and then calls the appropriate function.

## Conclusion and Next Steps (10 minutes)

In this lesson, we've implemented several NLP features to enhance our AI-assisted coding tool:

1. Natural language queries for code search
2. Code-to-natural language explanation system
3. Intent recognition for user commands
4. Context-aware chat system
5. Code summarization tool

These features significantly improve the user experience by allowing developers to interact with their codebase using natural language. However, there's always room for improvement:

1. Enhance the code search engine by incorporating more advanced NLP techniques like word embeddings or transformer models.
2. Improve the intent recognition system by using machine learning models trained on a large dataset of coding-related queries.
3. Extend the code explanation and summarization features to support multiple programming languages.
4. Implement a more sophisticated context management system for the chat feature, possibly incorporating long-term memory and retrieval.
5. Add more intents and features, such as code generation, refactoring suggestions, or bug detection.
